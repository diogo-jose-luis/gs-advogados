          "ABSTRACT",
          "This report examines the legal regime of single-member companies in the Angolan legal order. It studies the personal substratum that characterises single-member companies and distinguishes them from multi-member companies; the specific statute governing single-member companies in Angola; and other legislation directly or subsidiarily applicable to their organisation, incorporation and operation.",
          "The research is relevant to identify how the Angolan legal framework addresses single-member companies in various aspects. It relies on bibliographic and statutory sources and a deductive method to analyse the main points and their practical implications. The study is justified by the relative novelty of single-member forms in Angolan legislation.",

          "This article briefly outlines the evolution of partner exclusion in commercial companies, focusing on limited liability companies and its application within the Angolan legal system. From Roman Law—where any partner’s withdrawal dissolved the company—the text summarises later European rules that first introduced exclusion.",
          "In Angola, Portuguese-inspired legislation grounds this institute, applying exclusion in a limited and specific way depending on the company type. The paper reviews legal and contractual provisions enabling exclusion and suggests improvements to strengthen legal certainty in corporate relations."
